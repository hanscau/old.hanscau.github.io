			<h1>Invisible Tripwire Alarm</h1>
			<hr>
			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>Have you ever been falsely accused? Been wronged because the other party did not 
			know what you have done? Well I have. I have always been a diligent student, doing all 
			my homework before playing games or watching cute dog videos on Youtube. However, 
			my parents (or guardian for this matter) always comes in the wrong moments to see me always 
			playing and never studying. My guardians always have bad timing to come check on me to see me shouting 
			at my friend across the web. When I am studying, they do not come in at all.</p>
			<p>So what do I do? Should I then study 24/7 so that they can finally "catch" me playing?</p>
			<p>NO</p>
			<p>I'm an engineer and we solve problem by creating products, so I have decided to make a notification system that 
			will notify me when someone is entering my room (NOTE: There was another problem on how they can come in without me knowing too, so
			now I'm going to solve 2 problem with 1 solution)</p>
			<p>The system will be an Arduino shield that uses ultrasonic sensor to act as the "invisible tripwire" and a buzzer to notify me.</p>
			
			<h2>Component List</h2>
			<p>You would need...</p>
			<p>1x Arduino Uno</p>
			<p>1x Stripboard (at least 15 holes by 20 holes)</p>
			<p>1x 8pin leg</p>
			<p>2x 6pin leg</p>
			<p>1x Buzzer</p>
			<p>1x 2N222 BJT Transistor</p>
			<p>1x 330Ω resistor</p>
			<p>1x 1kΩ resistor</p>
			<p>1x Potentiometer (10kΩ)</p>
			<p>1x Ultrasonic sensor</p>
			<p>1x 9V battery</p>
			<p>A bunch of wire (not really actually, but oh well)</p>
			
			<h2>The S.H.I.E.L.D</h2>
			<p>For those who are curious how we are going to wire the individual components,
			here are the schematic for the individual parts namely the buzzer and 
			the potentiometer (ultrasonic sensor just plug and play so no schematic)</p>
			<img src="img/Schematic1.png" alt="1st schematic" id="blogImg">
			<p>The above is the schematic for the buzzer. Transistor to control the current flow 
			resistor to limit the current to protect the buzzer</p>
			<img src="img/Schematic2.png" alt="2nd schematic" id="blogImg">
			<p>Here the second one is the potentiometer schematic, we will be using the analog
			reader on the Arduino to read the voltage level across the 1kΩ resistor. (Any value is ok, 
			but 1k so we have a nicer gradient when varying the potentiometer which is 10kΩ</p>
			<p>Now with everything that you have, you can start soldering everything onto the stripboard</p>
			<img src="img/Schematic3.png" alt="3rd schematic" id="blogImg">
			<p>The "x"s on the board are holes that needs to be drilled onto the copper lanes to prevent them 
			from conducting</p>
			<p>Lines are wires, and the tiny squares are the connection to the Arduino</p>
			<p>If you are too lazy and have a PCB miller at home, here: <a href="resources/EA.brd">PCB design</a></p>
			
			<h2>Code</h2>
			<p>After you have soldered everything to the stripboard (or PCB), you can now plug it on top of an Arduino,
			plug in the Buzzer and power supply and load in the code below</p>
			<pre>
			<code>
#include &lt;Ultrasonic.h&gt;

const int pin = 5;  //Transistor Control Pin
Ultrasonic ultrasonic(7, 6); //Initialise Ultrasonic
int threshold = 0;  //Distance Threshold variable

void setup() {
  pinMode(A4, INPUT); //Set A4 as Analog Read
  pinMode(pin, OUTPUT); //Set pin 5 as output

  Serial.begin(9600); // Starts the serial communication
}

void loop() {
  int value = analogRead(A4); //Read from A4
  int distance = ultrasonic.distanceRead(); //Read from ultrasonic sensor

  threshold = map(value, 100, 1000, 5, 100); //Map threshold sensitivity

  //Print out all data
  Serial.print("Distance = ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.print(", Threshold = ");
  Serial.println(threshold);

  if (distance > threshold)
  {
    //Buzzer Off
    digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
  }
  else if (distance < threshold && distance > 0)
  {
    //Trigger Buzzer
    digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);
  }
  else  //when Ultrasonic sensor does not sense anything
  {
    //Buzzer Off
    digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
  }
}
