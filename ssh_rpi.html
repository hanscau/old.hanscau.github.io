			<h2>Setup RaspberryPi</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3>Resources</h3>
				<p>RaspberryPi</p>
				<p>SD card (recommended 8Gb)</p>
				<p>SD card reader (optional)</p>
				<h4>Internet connection thingy (choose 1)</h4>
				<p>Ethernet cable (with access to ethernet internet)</p>
				<p>USB Wifi adapter</p>
				<h4>Software</h4>
				<p>Raspberry OS <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/"> Raspbian</a></p>
				<p>SD card Flashing software <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a></p>
				<p>SSH connection software <a href="https://www.putty.org/">Putty</a></p>
				<p>VNC connection software <a href="https://www.tightvnc.com/">TightVNC</a></p>
				<p>IP address scanning software <a href="https://angryip.org/download/#windows">AngryIP</a></p>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>We will be trying to setup a RaspberryPi without any keyboard, mouse or monitor. In other words
				a "Headless" connection.</p>
			<p>This can be achieved by:</p>
			<p>1. Connecting the RPi to the internet without an interface</p>
			<p>2. SSHing into the RPi to start a VNC</p>
			<p>3. Using a VNC for remote control using your PC</p>
			<note>
				NOTE: Rpi = RaspberryPi
			</note>
			<h3>Setting up RaspberryPi</h3>
				<p>Download any Raspberry OS that you want and flash it using Etcher to your SD card</p>
				<p>I will be using Raspbian Strech Lite because I need all the extra space I can get from the RPi</p>
				<p>After flashing is complete with verification by Etcher we can start by conneting the RPi to the internet</p>
				<note>
					NOTE: IF ETCHER VERIFCATION FAIL, CONTINUE AT YOUR OWN RISKED (NOTE RECOMMENDED)
				</note>
			<h3>Connecting to the web</h3>
				<h3>Ethernet</h3>
				<p>Connect RPi to internet using ethernet</p>
				<p>Plug in and go to the next part</p>
				<h3>Wifi</h3>
				<h4>Headless connection</h4>
				<p>Using a card reader, insert in the SD card and open up the "boot" partition</p>
				<p>Make a new file named "wpa_supplicant.conf"</p>
				<p>In the file add in the following</p>
				<code>
					country=fr<br>
					update_config=1<br>
					ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant<br>
					<br>
					network={<br>
 					scan_ssid=1<br>
 					ssid="RouterName"<br>
 					psk="Password"<br>
 					key_mgmt=WPA-PSK<br>
					}
				</code>
				<p>Change "RounterName" to the name of the Wifi you want to connect</p>
				<p>Change "Password" to the password of the Wifi</p>
				<p>If your wifi is using WPE, change "key_mgmt=WPA-PSK" to</p>
				<code>
					key_mgmt=NONE
				</code>
				<p>If your wifi does not have a password, just enter in the ssid, delete the "psk" and "key_mgmt" line</p>
				<p>Its okay if your country code is different....</p>
				<note>
					NOTE: Add in the name and password with quotation mark
				</note>
			<h3>SSHing to 3.1415265</h3>
				<p>Before pluging the SD card into the RPi, also in the "boot" partition create a file
					called "ssh". No extension, no nothing, just a file that is called "ssh", this is to
					prompt the RPi to enable SSH connection</p>
				<p>Next, plug the SD card into the RPi and also the Wifi adapter(if you are using Wifi for connection)</p>
				<p>Then, after waiting for a bit for the RPi to boot and connect to the Wifi, use AngryIP to get the IP of your
					RPi, it should be under the host name raspberrypi</p>
				<p>Open Putty and copy the IP adress of the Rpi into the blank. Allow
					the port to be default (22) and select SSH. Connect!</p>
				<p>When SSH connects, login as (if you didn't change it)</p>
				<p>id=pi</p>
				<p>password=raspberry</p>
				<note>
					NOTE: When typing password, you cannot see the word... its a Linux thing i think
				</note>
				<p>Now with SSH connection complete, we will setup the VNC</p>
			<h3>Veins N Capillary poping up trying to do this</h3>
			  <p>The reason why you would need a VNC connection is so that there is a graphical interface, an SSH can only
					provide a comandline interface control</p>
				<p>To continue, now having a SSH control to the Rpi, lets get the VNC software.Run the following</p>
				<code>
					sudo apt-get upgrade<br>
					sudo apt-get update<br>
					sudo apt-get install tightvncserver<br>
				</code>
				<p>If installation is complete, start the vnc!</p>
				<code>
					/usr/bin/tightvncserver
				</code>
				<p>When the code is executed, it will prompt for a password so just give it a password</p>
				<p>After that, it will ask for a viewonly password, just no it</p>
				<p>With the VNC on your RPi running, go to your PC and start the TightVNC Viewer (search it up its not automaticall in your desktop...)</p>
				<p>using the same IP as when you SSH, put it as the "Remote Host" in the following fashion</p>
				<p>192.168.0.10::5901</p>
				<p>Change "192.168.0.10" to your own IP address, but the port number should be the same</p>
				<img src="img/VNCConnection.JPG" alt="VNC Connetion Pic" id="blogImg">
				<p>Then connect, it will prompt for a password so enter the password you setup previously and you are connected!</p>
				<p>CONGRATZ!!!!</p>
			<h3>Discalmer</h3>
				<p>Take note that the VNC will not automatically start up when you start the RPi, you have to SSH into it to start
					the VNC first before connecting to it using VNC</p>
				<p>Also take note that the "Lite" version of the Raspbian does not contain a GUI, so VNCing into it will produce a error.
					If you want to have the graphical interace, run the following</p>
					<code>
						sudo apt install raspberrypi-ui-mods
					</code>
			<h3>If you lazy and want VNC to start up automatically with RPi</h3>
